It is haded by the Federation Council with a democratically elected president; the incumbent prsident is President Anton Chekov.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nComprising of 196 member nation states with hundreds of affiliates across thousands of inhabited worlds, the Federation prides itself on its enlightened principles of liberty, equality, justice, peaceful co-existence and progress for the good of all species. Its paramilitary arm, Starfleet, serves as a galactic peacekeeping armada and expeditionary force.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the Federation is an idealistic utopia, the galaxy at large is not the same. Throughout the centuries since it was founded in 2161, it has had to engage in many conflicts with other galactic powers. From the Romulans, to the Klingons, the Tzenkethi, Borg, Dominion, and more, Starfleet has fought in many interstellar conflicts. This proved to put the Federation through the most hardship in the latter half of the 24th century. Two major Borg Incursions, another war with the Klingons, and the Dominion War had a heavy toll on the Federation and the wider galaxy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the Federation being the largest superpower standing, it has since rebuilt from its losses and has helped other galactic powers to do so too. However, the start of the 25th century was punctuated by the Frontier Day Crisis, resulting in major losses to the Home Fleet and a reassesment of fleetwide operating protocols.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the current year of 2404, Starfleet is once again the most powerful single force in the galaxy, and now continues its peacekeeping and humanitarian missions everywhere in the two quadrants.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"icon\\\":\\\"20\\\",\\\"color\\\":\\\"#ffffff\\\",\\\"picture\\\":\\\"strpg/diplomacy_banner/federation_of_planets\\\",\\\"maxRep\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"ranks\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"generic_negative3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_neutral\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive3\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Klingon Empire\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"Galactic Powers\\\",\\\"startingReputation\\\":\\\"1500\\\",\\\"discovered\\\":\\\"false\\\",\\\"actorId\\\":\\\"65\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe Klingon Empire was once a proud and noble warrior race, but in the aftermath of the Dominion War, its standing among its peers in the Alpha Quadrant has languished. The current leader of the Empire is Chancellor Toral, son of Duras. Although the circumstances of his ascension to power is considered by many to be suspect, the Federation has not interfered in what it considers to be an \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"internal Klingon matter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPublicly, Federation-Klingon relations are amicable at best, however many within the upper echelons of Starfleet internally oppose him. Through means currently unknown even to Starfleet Intelligence, Toral had been amassing power behind the scenes during Chancellor Martok and K'orin's reigns, and it is currently believed that Toral has bought out most of the Great Houses, leading to his  current Chancellorship.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring the Dominion War, the Klingon Empire's warrior tactics resulted in the Empire suffering heavy losses. Although the Empire had spent several years rebuilding their navy and defences, several factors have resulted in their efforts continuing to this day. In 2384, with convincing from Admiral Picard and Captain Worf, the then-Chancellor Martok had diverted shipbuilding capability and material support away from the Empire's rebuilding efforts and towards assisting the construction of the Romulan Rescue Armada. While this proved unpopular among the Klingon populace who still had anti-Romulan sentiment, the action was nonetheless approved by the High Council as Martok's reputation during the Dominion War still held strong.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollowing the destruction of Utopia Planitia in 2385 and resources being redirected back to rebuilding the Empire, public opinion of Chancellor Martok once again soured as he opened the borders to Romulan Refugees in the wake of the Supernova. Worf, now retired from Starfleet, returns to Martok's side during this time. Unfortunately, with outer Klingon colonies still not redeveloped after the Dominion War, high tensions between the existing Klingons and the newly resettled Romulan colonists have caused the Klingon border to fall to lawlessness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith Worf being recalled to Starfleet Intelligence amidst a new internal crisis, Martok stood alone among an increasingly tense High Council. Before mounting political pressure boiled over with his deposition, he chose to resign, giving the chancelloship to former Ambassador K'orin in 2391. A decorated officer with high public opinion, Martok knew that K'orin's time as ambassador Tulgana IV near the Romulan District would qualify him as a sympathiser to the refugees. Martok retires to his ancestral home in the Ketha Lowlands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile K'orin's chancellorship remains highly regarded, it came to an untimely early end in 2400 when his flagship was destroyed over Fenton IV during a joint operation with Starfleet's own flagship. In the wake of his death, Emperor Kahless II temporarily led the increasingly tumultuous High Council. With the Empire in disarray, Martok sought guidance on Boreth.

Without a planet to call home, this new government is headquartered on the Scarpa Varia.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Scarpa Varia was a starliner built by the Romulans after the infamous Shinzon coup. It was originally intended as a civilian tourist starliner as part of a multidisciplinary effort to make the Star Empire more open on the galactic stage. It was constructed with the aid of Risian Heavy Industries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the Romulan Sun was found to be imminently going supernova, the Scarpa Varia was converted into a refugee and command ship. It was from here that the Romulan Senate coordinated their evacuation efforts; of course, the Tal Shiar were pulling the strings behind the scenes, and ensured that loyalists were prioritised using their own fleet of warbirds and bombers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the Supernova, the Scarpa Varia relocated its refugees to various planets in Romulan space. In the years since, it has been converted into a mobile headquarters, housing the ranking officials of Romulan Free State. The Scarpa Varia can frequently be found in the vicinity of the Hobus Nebula - the gas cloud that remains of the Romulan Sun - escorted by aging Valdore and D'deridex-Class warbirds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith practically no resources to its name, the Romulan Free State has a loose grip on its territory, with pirates and warlords rampant across refugee systems, and extremist factions such as the Romulan Rebirth Movement free to roam across the colonies. This has resulted in the Fenris Rangers serving as peacekeepers along the former Romulan Neutral Zone as well as the Klingon's Designated Sectors\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn an effort to portray itself as a relavant galactic power where the Star Empire once stood, the Free State controls the Artifact; a damaged Borg Cube first reactivated unintentionally by the USS Protostar's civilian crew and later disabled by the Tal Shiar. During the events of Oh's Admonition, the Artifact (and thus, the Romulan Reclamation Site) was moved to Coppelius. The highly regulated and prestigious Borg Artifact Research Institute now works alongside the Coppelian Synthetics with the Borg Reclamation Project. Those projects are overseen by Executive Director Hugh, who has since recovered thanks to the Synth's and Altan Inigo Soong's advanced technology.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"icon\\\":\\\"20\\\",\\\"color\\\":\\\"#ffffff\\\",\\\"picture\\\":\\\"strpg/diplomacy_banner/maquis_resurgence\\\",\\\"maxRep\\\":\\\"1000\\\",\\\"ranks\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"generic_negative3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_neutral\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive3\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"New Cardassian Union\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"Galactic Powers\\\",\\\"startingReputation\\\":\\\"1600\\\",\\\"discovered\\\":\\\"true\\\",\\\"actorId\\\":\\\"63\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe Cardassian Union is an interstellar power based in the Alpha Quadrant. Formerly an ally to the Dominion during the Dominion War, their resultinng rebellion turned the tide against what turned out to be their opressors in the War's final hours.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith Cardassia as a planet and its territories decimated during the War and The Fire, and its military might greatly diminished as a result of reparations in the Dominion War Accords, the Cardassian Union now relies on Federation aid to maintain its border and its colonies from acts of piracy and terrorism by the Maquis Resurgence. Once stereotyped as a race of stubborn people, Cardassians in the post-war generally accept aid from their new Starfleet allies, though it can take some convincing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile functionally a military dictatorship before the War, the New Cardassian Union is now run as a democracy. Most military leaders that served during the Dominion War were extradited to the Federation for post-War trials, which had opened the door to further trials by the Bajoran Republic for their atrocities during the Occupation of Bajor. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe current head of state of the Union is the Castellan Garak, elected by the majority with highly favorable public opinion for his acts in service of the Cardassian Liberation Front; him fighting alongside Damar in the final hours of the War to overthrow the Dominion. While in the decades since - and with aid from the Federation - Cardassia has become more stable and livable, a vocal political minority has started to arise disparaging the Federation, considering Cardassia to now be occupied by those who gave them aid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis new movement has also led to the revival of the True Way in the aftermath of the war. An extremist separatist terrorist group that once considered the Federation to be Cardassia's mortal enemy, they had operated before the war and performed assassination attempts against Starfleet and the Bajoran Republic. Now, with the revival of anti-Federation sentiment, former operatives that have gained support have started to peform terrorist actions on the Federation border. With the Union's military hampered in numbers, only Starfleet has the capability to defend itself.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"icon\\\":\\\"20\\\",\\\"color\\\":\\\"#ffffff\\\",\\\"picture\\\":\\\"strpg/diplomacy_banner/new_cardassian_union\\\",\\\"maxRep\\\":\\\"1000\\\",\\\"ranks\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"generic_negative3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_neutral\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive3\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Maquis Resurgence\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"Galactic Powers\\\",\\\"startingReputation\\\":\\\"1200\\\",\\\"discovered\\\":\\\"true\\\",\\\"actorId\\\":\\\"62\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nWhen the first conflict between the Federation and the Cardassian Union ended, colonies on both sides of the new Cardassian demilitarized zone was ceded to the other faction as part of their long-negotiated peace treaty.\\\\\\\\nNot wanting to leave their homeworlds, with some having been colonized for generations, the colonists rebelled, resulting in civil unrest and the formation of the original Maquis Resistance.\\\\\\\\nConsidered traitors and outlaws by Starfleet, and terrorists by the Cardassians, the Maquis continued to fight for their homes. Their fight came to a premature end when the Cardassian Union pledged allegiance to the Dominion, the latter of which had firepower far beyond the rogue group's capabilities, and thus, the Maquis were wiped out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the Dominion War, territorial reparations by the Cardassian Union resulted in most former Maquis colonies to be ceded back to the Federation, though many were rendered uninhabitable by the Dominion, with terraforming and resettlement projects ongoing to this day. However, a new terrorist group has arisen in the new Cardassian-Federation Border.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFormed by surviving members of the original Maquis colonies, Starfleet Dominion War veterans, and others unhappy with the Treaty of Bajor and the Dominion War Accords, the new Maquis Resurgence has begun striking Cardassian colonies along the border. With the Cardassian Union's military strength severely decreased as a result of the Accords, the Union does not have enough ships or manpower to maintain border stability, with efforts focused on rebuilding their own colonies. This has resulted in the need for Starfleet aid in repelling the Maquis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the original Maquis's cause is regarded by many in hindsight to have had merit, most of the members of the Maquis Resurgence are fighting not for their homes being taken away, but as an act of revenge against the Cardassians for their atrocities during the Occupation of Bajor through to the Dominion War. Many of the former-Starfleet members of the Resurgence had suffered losses of close ones during the war, and now fight alongside some surviving members of the original Maquis and similar groups such as the Kohn-Ma for retribution against Cardassians.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"icon\\\":\\\"20\\\",\\\"color\\\":\\\"#ffffff\\\",\\\"picture\\\":\\\"strpg/diplomacy_banner/maquis_resurgence\\\",\\\"maxRep\\\":\\\"1000\\\",\\\"ranks\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"generic_negative3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_negative1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_neutral\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"generic_positive3\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\"]","Reputation
